# OpenPadi Community

**OpenPadi** is a growing community of African techies — developers, designers, product minds, and curious learners — working together to gain real-world experience by building open-source tools, solving real challenges, and supporting each other.

We believe that learning shouldn't end at tutorials. That’s why we’re creating a space where people grow through **hands-on tasks**, **mentorship**, and **collaborative projects** — not just coders, but everyone in tech.

Whether you're writing code, managing products, designing user experiences, or keeping projects organized — **you belong here**.

## 🚀 How to Get Involved

We use an **open contribution model** — anyone can start contributing right away:

### ✅ Steps to get started:

1. **Fork the repo** you want to contribute to
2. **Read the `README.md`** of that specific project carefully
3. **Check the [Issues tab](https://github.com/openpadi)** for tasks, features, or bugs
4. Look out for labels like `good first issue`, `bug`, or `help wanted`
5. Comment on the issue to “claim” it (if needed)
6. Create a new branch and make your changes
7. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** with a clear summary of what you did
8. Wait for feedback and updates from maintainers

👀 Always check if someone is already working on an issue before you start.
